# ðŸ“¸ Picture Organiser - Backend

## First Steps

Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Run the development server:
```
npm run dev
```

## Before you start
- Ensure you have the correct version of Node.js installed.
- Ensure you you have the correct credentials for the database.


## Technical Notes

The backend project uses Node.js and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) as a web framework.

For the database, I'm using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as a NoSQL database.
